Some Important Assumptions 
-----------------------------

1. [proc [ident(x1)...ident(xn)] s] is represented as [proceed [ident(x1)...ident(xn)] s]

2. Our Case statement: We are assuming P to be a record. If ident(x) isn't a record, we go for S2. If both X and P aren't record then we go for S1 and if ident(x) is a record but P isn't then we go for S2.

Features
-----------

Our implementation supports :

* Record unification with an unbound variable which is later bound.

for example 

{Handle [localvar ident(foo)
  [localvar ident(bar) [localvar ident(x) [
   [[bind ident(foo) [record literal(person) [[literal(name) ident(x)]]]]
    [bind ident(bar) [record literal(person) [[literal(name) literal(10)]]]]
    [bind ident(foo) ident(bar)]]]]]] }
