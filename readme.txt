TODO:
1.
Y=10
X=10 // Here X and Y should be in same equivalence class

2. Can there be record within record? tough to deal

Our Case statement: We are assuming P to be a record. If X isn't a record, we go for S2. If both X and P aren't record then we go for S1 and if X is a record but P isn't then we go for S2.

3. We aren't supporting proceedures in record
